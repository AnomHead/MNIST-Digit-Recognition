# MNIST-Digit-Recognition

This is a mini project which will analyse the data in a MNIST dataset which stores pixel intensity values instead of being as an image, and it will predict which digit the given set of pixel values can indicate.

# Pre-requisites

For this project, a good understanding of the working of basic machine learning models like linear regression, softmax regression, logistic regression is expected to be able to understand the code. Also a basic understanding of the pandas library, the process of data cleaning must have been understood. Also basic knowledge on the working of neural networks and its respective pre-requisities. 

# Usage 

This project can be used to predict the handwritten digits based on pixel data, hence if images with raw pixel data are present, it can be used here.
